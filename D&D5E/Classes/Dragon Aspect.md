You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a quarterstaff or (b) any simple weapon
- (a) leather armor or (b) scale mail
- an explorer's pack, a dagger, and an arcane focus

## Draconic Magic
Your bear the gift of a powerful dragon. This gift, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See [Spells Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting) for the general rules of spellcasting and the [Spells Listing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=3&filter-class=6&filter-search=&filter-verbal=&filter-somatic=&filter-material=&filter-concentration=&filter-ritual=&filter-sub-class=) for your spell list. You can learn spells from the Druid and Sorcerer spell lists.

### *Cantrips*
You know two cantrips of your choice from the Dragon Aspect spell list. You learn additional Dragon Aspect cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Dragon Aspect table.

### *Spell Slots*
The Dragon Aspect table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Dragon Aspect spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows the level of those slots. All of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your Dragon Aspect spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Draconic Magic spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

### *Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher*
At 1st level, you know one 1st-level spell of your choice from the Dragon Aspect spell list.

The Spells column of the Dragon Aspect table shows when you learn more Dragon Aspect spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new Dragon Aspect spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Dragon Aspect spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Dragon Aspect spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### *Spellcasting Ability*
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Dragon Aspect spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Dragon Aspect spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### *Spellcasting Focus*
You can use an arcane focus (see the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus) section) as a spellcasting focus for your Dragon Aspect spells.

## Essence
You pick an Essence from Autumn, Spring, Summer, Winter, or Time. Along with suggesting some personality traits, your Essense determines the color of your dragon scales, the color of your luminescent eyes in humanoid form, your Essence damage type, and various other features you will gain as you level up as a Dragon Aspect. 

As part of selecting your Essence, your creature type becomes both Humanoid and Dragon . You learn to speak, read, and write Draconic.

## Aspect Transformation
You learn to control your magical shapeshifting ability enabling you to shift in to your dragon form and back to your humanoid form at will as a bonus action. You automatically revert to your humanoid form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While in your dragon form the following rules apply:

- Your size changes based on the Aspect Size column of the Dragon Aspect table, your AC becomes 10 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus, you become immune to your Essence damage type, but the rest of your game statistics and personality traits remain the same.
- You can't cast spells, but can still use spell slots in conjunction with your Dragon Breath feature. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you’ve already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
- You gain access to the natural weapons of a dragon: bite, claws, and tail. You use your Charisma modifier instead of Strength to determine your attack and damage rolls with them.

> ## Bite
> Your bite deals 1d10 piercing damage and has a range of 5 feet.
>
> The damage of your bite increases to 2d10 at 11th level. The range of your bite increases to 10 feet at 11th level and 15 feet at 17th level.

> ## Claws
> Your claws deal 1d8 slashing damage and have a range of 5 feet.
>
> The damage of your claws increases to 2d8 at 11th level. The range of your claws increases to 10 feet at 17th level.

> ## Tail
> Your tails deals 1d8 bludgeoning and has a range of 10 feet.
>
> The damage of your tail increases to 2d8 at 11th level. The range of your tail increases to 15 feet at 11th level and 20 feet at 17th level.

## Dragon Breath
You learn to use one of the most noteable draconc abilities, Dragon Breath. As an action, you release a breath of primal energy in a cone with a length in feet equal to 10 times your proficiency bonus. The length is halved in humanoid form. Each creature in the area must making a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature takes a number of dice of damage equal to your proficiency bonus. On a success, the creature takes half as much. The damage type of your Dragon Breath is your Essence damage type, and the size of the damage dice can be seen in the Breath Die column of the Dragon Aspect table.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until it recharges. At the start of your turn, roll a D6. On a roll of 5 or 6, your Dragon Breath recharges. At 20th level, your Dragon Breath recharges on a roll of 4 or higher.

You can increase the damage of your Dragon Breath by expending a spell slot as part of the same action. You increase the number of damage dice for Dragon Breath by one plus the level of the spell slot expended.

## Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

## Aspect Transformation Improvements
The ability and trait improvements below provide bonuses during Aspect Transformation at the listed levels.

> ## Combat Improvements
> At 5th level, you can make two attacks instead of one when you take the Attack action. 
>
> Your attacks with natural weapons gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls at 5th level, and the bonus increases further to +2 at 11th level, and +3 at 17th level.

> ## Flying
> At 5th level, you gain a flying speed of 30 feet. This speed increases to 60 feet at 9th level, 90 feet at 13th level, and 120 feet at 17th level.

> ## Senses
> At 5th level, you gain 120 feet of darkvision . If you already have darkvision from another source, increase it by 60 feet instead. Your senses continue to hone themselves as you gain 30 feet of blindsight at 9th level.

> ## Wing Attack
> Starting at 13th level, as an action, you beat your wings fervently. Each creature within 10 feet of the you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

## Innate Magic
The natural magic running through your veins seeps into everything you do. Your natural weapon attacks during Aspect Transformation count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

## Elemental Potency
Your spells and abilities that deal your Essence damage type ignore resistance and treat immunity as resistance.

## Environmental Control
You can cast the [Control Weather](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:control-weather) spell once without using a spell slot. You regain the use of this ability after you complete a short or long rest.

## Force of Nature

- You can cast spells during Aspect Transformation.
- You have advantage on saving throws against Draconic Breath from other dragons.
- You regain 20 hit points at the start of your each of your turns.
- The length of your Dragon Breath patterns are doubled.
- You become immune to your Essence damage type in humanoid form and regains a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt to you during Aspect Transformation.
- Once per long rest, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.
